# CTF Challenge Writeup
**Name:** Vigenere Cipher
**Points:** 20
**Category:** Cryptography
**Objective:** To learn about Vigenere ciphers

## Solution

1. **Introduction to Vigenere Ciphers**
   - When it comes to Vigenere ciphers, they require a specific key to decode the message. This key is crucial to deciphering the encrypted text.

2. **Provided Key**
   - Fortunately, in this challenge, the key was provided. This made the decryption process straightforward since I didn't have to guess or deduce the key.

3. **Using Dcode.xyz**
   - To solve this Vigenere cipher challenge, I turned to an online tool called `dcode.xyz`. This tool is quite handy for tackling a wide range of encryption and decryption tasks.

4. **Decrypting with the Key**
   - With the key in hand, I input the encrypted text and the key into `dcode.xyz`. The tool swiftly decrypted the message, revealing the flag.

## Flag
The flag for the Vigenere Cipher challenge is `CTFlearn{XXXXXXXXXX}`. Ensure you replace 'XXXXXXXXXX' with the actual flag you obtained after using the provided key and `dcode.xyz` to decode the message.

Well done on completing this Cryptography challenge! You've gained valuable insights into Vigenere ciphers and their decryption process.
