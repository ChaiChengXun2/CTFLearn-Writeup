**Name of Challenge:** Blank Page
**Points:** 30
**Category:** Forensics

**Objective:**

In the "Blank Page" challenge, your objective is to uncover the hidden message or flag contained within a seemingly empty file. This challenge involves investigating the file's binary content to decode the hidden information.

**Solution:**

1. Begin by examining the provided file in the "Blank Page" challenge. When you first open the file using the `cat` command, you may notice that it produces empty output, appearing as a blank page.

2. Suspect that there might be hidden information within the binary content of the file. To further explore this, use the `xxd` command. The `xxd` command is a utility that displays a hex dump of a file's binary data, which can help reveal any hidden patterns.

3. Execute the following command to generate the hex dump of the file:

    ```
    xxd <filename>
    ```

4. Examine the hex dump output. In this case, you may find that the output only contains two characters: space (' ') and period ('.'). 

5. To decipher the message hidden within these binary patterns, we can assign values to the characters. For instance, you can consider space (' ') as 1 and period ('.') as 0.

6. Now, by interpreting these binary values (1s and 0s), you can reconstruct the hidden message or flag.

7. Try different combinations to decode the message, such as considering space as 1 and period as 0 or vice versa. In your case, you found that considering space as 1 and period as 0 worked.

8. The hidden flag within the file will typically be presented in the format `ctflearn{XXXXXXXXXX}`. Extract the flag from the binary content using your interpretation and submit it to complete the challenge.

**Flag:**

The flag for the "Blank Page" challenge is `ctflearn{XXXXXXXXXX}`. By using the `xxd` command to examine the binary content of the provided file and decoding the hidden binary message based on your interpretation, you can successfully uncover the flag and complete the challenge.
