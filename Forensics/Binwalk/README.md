# binwalk

**Points:** 30  
**Category:** Forensics

## Objective

The objective of this challenge is to retrieve a hidden flag that is embedded within a file. The challenge name hints at the usage of a tool called "binwalk."

## Solution

1. Using Binwalk:
   - The challenge name suggests that you should utilize ```binwalk```. To do this, you can run the command `binwalk -e <filename>` on the given file. The `-e` option is used to extract any embedded files from within the target file.

2. Trying Alternative Solutions:
   - If the "binwalk" command does not yield the expected results or you encounter difficulties, you can opt for an alternative tool like ```foremost```.

3. Using Foremost:
   - Run ```foremost``` on the target file. This tool is designed to extract embedded files and may be more effective in this case.
   - The output of ```foremost``` is typically a folder named ```output```.

4. Locate the Flag:
   - Navigate through the ```output``` directory and explore the extracted images or files to locate the hidden flag.

The approach you take may depend on your familiarity with the tools or the specific characteristics of the challenge.

## Flag

The flag for this challenge is: `ABCTF{XXXXXXXXXX}`.
