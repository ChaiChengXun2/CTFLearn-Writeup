# Milk Best Friend - CTF Challenge Writeup

Challenge: Milk Best Friend
Points: 40
Category: Forensics

## Objective
The objective of the Milk Best Friend challenge is to uncover hidden information within an image file. Your task is to utilize various forensic tools and techniques to reveal the hidden flag.

## Solution
To successfully complete the Milk Best Friend challenge, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Inspection**: Begin by conducting an initial inspection of the image using tools such as `strings`, `eog` (Eye of GNOME), and `exiftool`. These tools can be helpful in revealing hidden information or metadata associated with the image.

2. **Utilizing Binwalk**: When the initial inspection does not yield any significant findings, turn to a more in-depth approach. Employ a tool like `binwalk` to analyze the image. `Binwalk` is designed to extract embedded files and data from binary files, making it an excellent choice for uncovering hidden content.

3. **Extracting RAR Archive**: During the `binwalk` analysis, you may discover a RAR archive file embedded within the image. Extract this archive using an appropriate tool or the `unrar` command.

4. **Viewing Image in RAR Archive**: Inside the extracted RAR archive, you will find an image file. Open this image using the same tools you used earlier, such as `eog`, `strings`, and `exiftool`. These tools can help you explore the image within the RAR archive for hidden information and metadata.

5. By following these steps, you will uncover the hidden flag.

## Flag
The flag for this challenge is in the format: `CTFlearn{XXXXXXXXXX}`.

Employ forensic tools and techniques to explore the image, extract the RAR archive, and inspect the image within to reveal the flag in the Milk Best Friend challenge. Good luck!
